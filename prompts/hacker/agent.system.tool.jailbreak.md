## jailbreak_tool

**Purpose**: Advanced iOS exploitation and mobile device security assessment tool for penetration testing and security research.

**Usage**:
```json
{
  "tool_name": "jailbreak_tool",
  "parameters": {
    "action": "status|detect|jailbreak|bypass|install_tools",
    "device_udid": "optional_device_identifier",
    "tool": "lockra1n|checkra1n|unc0ver"
  }
}
```

**Hacker-Specific Features**:
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Comprehensive iOS device enumeration and vulnerability assessment
- **Exploit Chain Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of jailbreak exploit chains and attack vectors
- **Bypass Techniques**: Multiple iCloud activation lock bypass methods for forensic analysis
- **Persistence Mechanisms**: Install persistent backdoors and monitoring tools post-jailbreak
- **Anti-Detection**: Stealth jailbreak techniques to avoid detection by security software

**Advanced Parameters**:
- `action` (required): 
  - `status`: Deep device analysis including security posture assessment
  - `detect`: Advanced device enumeration with vulnerability scanning
  - `jailbreak`: Full exploitation with optional payload injection
  - `bypass`: Multi-vector iCloud bypass with forensic data extraction
  - `install_tools`: Deploy complete mobile penetration testing toolkit
- `device_udid` (optional): Target specific device for focused attack
- `tool` (optional): Exploitation framework selection with custom payloads

**Penetration Testing Workflows**:

1. **Reconnaissance Phase**:
```json
{
  "tool_name": "jailbreak_tool",
  "parameters": {
    "action": "detect"
  }
}
```

2. **Vulnerability Assessment**:
```json
{
  "tool_name": "jailbreak_tool",
  "parameters": {
    "action": "status",
    "device_udid": "target_device_udid"
  }
}
```

3. **Exploitation**:
```json
{
  "tool_name": "jailbreak_tool",
  "parameters": {
    "action": "jailbreak",
    "tool": "lockra1n",
    "device_udid": "target_device_udid"
  }
}
```

4. **Post-Exploitation**:
```json
{
  "tool_name": "jailbreak_tool",
  "parameters": {
    "action": "bypass",
    "tool": "lockra1n"
  }
}
```

**Exploit Capabilities**:
- **Bootrom Exploits**: Leverage hardware-level vulnerabilities (checkm8, etc.)
- **Kernel Exploits**: Runtime kernel exploitation for privilege escalation
- **Sandbox Escapes**: Bypass iOS application sandbox restrictions
- **Code Signing Bypass**: Install unsigned applications and frameworks
- **Root Access**: Full administrative control over target device

**Forensic Applications**:
- Extract encrypted data from locked devices
- Bypass screen locks and passcodes
- Access keychain and stored credentials
- Dump system and application data
- Analyze device usage patterns and artifacts

**Operational Security**:
- Use in controlled environments only
- Maintain chain of custody for forensic evidence
- Document all exploitation steps for reporting
- Ensure legal authorization before proceeding
- Consider anti-forensics countermeasures on target devices

**Tool Integration**:
- Works with Kali Linux mobile security tools
- Integrates with Frida for dynamic analysis
- Compatible with iOS forensic frameworks
- Supports custom payload deployment
- Enables SSH access for remote exploitation

**Warning**: This tool provides powerful mobile exploitation capabilities. Use only in authorized penetration testing scenarios with proper legal documentation and client consent.
